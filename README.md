Task -Build a GraphQL API

GraphQL is a query language and a server-side runtime (typically served  over HTTP). GraphQL is a language for querying data. Unlike most query languages (such as SQL), you don’t use GraphQL to query a particular type of data store (such as a MySQL database). Instead, you use GraphQL to query data from any number of different sources.

You have to create a GraphQL API by following the steps below

Create a new project on your device and install the graphQL dependencies using the terminal
Create a schema for startups in the index.js file
Hardcode an array of startups you want to query on
Now, you’ll create the ‘resolvers’ object and connect it to the hardcoded data
Create the ‘ApolloServer’ instance in the end of index.js file
Run using the command ‘node index.js’
